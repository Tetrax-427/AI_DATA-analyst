# 📊 LLM-Powered Data Analyst

## 📌 Overview

The **LLM-Powered Data Analyst** allows users to analyze data through **natural language queries**. Users can upload CSV files or connect to a database, and the assistant interprets questions, writes Python/pandas code, runs it, and returns data insights and visualizations.

This project showcases **LLM reasoning, tool use, and data analysis capabilities**, making data exploration accessible to non-programmers.

## 🚀 What the Project Does

- Accepts CSV uploads or connects to databases (e.g., **DuckDB**)
- Understands plain English questions like:
  - “What are the top 5 selling products?”
  - “Show me a bar chart of sales over time.”
- Uses LLMs to generate and execute **Python/pandas** code
- Returns:
  - Data summaries
  - Visualizations (**matplotlib**, **Plotly**)
  - Insights in natural language

## 🎯 What I Want to Do

- Add support for SQL-based backends (e.g., PostgreSQL)
- Enable filtering, grouping, and time-based slicing via text
- Improve chart customization (titles, legends, formatting)
- Allow conversational refinement of queries
- Build a simple UI (web-based or CLI)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **LLMs**: GPT-4 (Code Interpreter or API)
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, Plotly
- **Database**: DuckDB (with potential for expansion)
- **Framework**: LangChain for orchestration
- **Optional**: Streamlit, FastAPI for user interface

## 🧪 Example Use Case

> **User Query**: _"What were the average monthly sales in 2024? Plot it as a line chart."_

Output:
- Executed pandas code to compute averages
- Line chart rendered using matplotlib or Plotly
- Natural language summary of the findings
